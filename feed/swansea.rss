<title>Tour of Britain 2010</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A year ago &lt;a href="http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/tour-of-britain-2009.html"&gt;I watched the start&lt;/a&gt; of a Tour of Britain stage. This year I caught the end of a stage, joining the crowds gathered on Constitution Hill, a vicious little cobbled climb near the centre of Swansea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked slowly up the road. A sea mist obscured the view back over Swansea Bay. I stopped about &amp;frac34; of the way up. I waited. The riders were late &amp;#8212; headwinds and rain had slowed their progress over the Black Mountains. I called Dan. He said he was about &amp;#8531; of the way up the hill, with a couple of friends. I walked back down to meet them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A car came past. A convoy of police riders. Then nothing. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where&amp;#8217;s Brad Wiggins? someone next to me asked. What colour is he wearing? Black with a green band, I said. He rides for Team Sky. I don&amp;#8217;t know where he is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A police 4x4 stormed up the hill, flattening the spectators back against the sides of the road. And now the leading riders were here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4987111756/" title="Heavy going by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4112/4987111756_f22f4fa392_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Heavy going" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d been assuming the pros would demolish the hill. Not so. They made it look hard going, hauling round mighty gears, their spindly bikes buckling beneath them. It&amp;#8217;s true, you get close enough to touch them. Some of these guys are way too big and solid to ride up hills.

<title>Constitution Hill</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.tourofbritain.co.uk/_ns_race/default.asp?section=stage3_route"&gt;Welsh stage&lt;/a&gt; of the Tour of Britain finishes in Swansea. Soon after 1pm the leading riders hurtle through the city centre along Kingsway, which is where the race will also finish, but not before they&amp;#8217;ve taken on a couple of steep climbs. First Bryn-y-M&amp;ocirc;r, near where Dan lives, then Constitution Hill, which is where I plan to be watching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230; the leading riders will face a last few metres of flat before the road veers upwards and onto over 300 metres of steep cobbles that lead them up onto the Swansea skyline. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hills + cobbles? Ouch!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/w2CURwHjJiw?#t=9s&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/w2CURwHjJiw?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Constitution+Hill,+Swansea"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicated that Constitution Hill featured in the Keith Allen&amp;#8217;s sensitive, wry evocation of a Swansea youth, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120394/" title="Twin Town, imdb"&gt;Twin Town&lt;/a&gt;. The road is now closed to traffic after too many idiots copied the Lewis twins&amp;#8217; driving stunt (seconds 7 to 17 of the YouTube montage above).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4941877207/" title="At the foot of Constitution Hill by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4941877207_45790f4563.jpg" width="408" height="500" alt="At the foot of Constitution Hill" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rode up Constitution Hill on Thursday, on my way back home from Swansea station. The train was 45 minutes late, spoiling my plans to meet the family at Parc Abertawe in time for Toy Story 3. I needed to do something to vent my frustration. It&amp;#8217;s a tough little climb, tougher than it looks from the bottom, especially if you&amp;#8217;re carrying a rucksack with a 15&amp;#8221; laptop in it, but the view from the top over Swansea bay is stunning.
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mumbles Triathlon 2010</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed watching today&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.mumblestri.com/"&gt;Mumbles triathlon&lt;/a&gt;. Conditions were perfect: bright and warm but, at 07:00 in the morning, not yet too hot. No wind, no waves. Swansea bay looked at its best. I knew at least three people taking part but had trouble identifying them. Everyone looks much the same in a wetsuit and swimming hat. I also spotted a cyclist I see on the train. The leading swimmer went like a torpedo. He also swam the triangular route directly, cutting between a couple of boats moored offshore. Everyone else followed a curving line back to the slipway. Then it all got a bit confusing, because the event combined a short and long sprint, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t tell who was in which event.
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tesco Express car park, Sketty</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Good to see &lt;a href="http://bristolcars.blogspot.com/2009/12/bus-passengers-cost-shops-money.html"&gt;bus passengers being told just where they stand&lt;/a&gt; in one of Bristol&amp;#8217;s premiere shopping centres. Over in Swansea, too, the car &amp;rarr; driver &amp;rarr; bus  &amp;rarr; passenger heirarchy is rigidly enforced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4173953288/" title="DSC00031 by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2631/4173953288_7652259fa3.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="DSC00031" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, while waiting with Alex for the 118, this bus parking area in Sketty was permanently occupied by a stream of cars using the new Tesco Express. The driver of S866NLT kept the engine running while a brave shopping partner visited the outside world &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s nothing worse than a cold car, and if you&amp;#8217;re sad enough to use a bus you&amp;#8217;ll probably enjoy exhaust fumes too.
