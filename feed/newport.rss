<title>Back to the velodrome</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Back to the velodrome today for a third session, this time with four of us. They&amp;#8217;ve extended the novice session, which now runs for a couple of hours, meaning you get a much better go. We were practising short sprints from the head of the pack when someone took a tumble. He was riding just above the blue line. Luckily I wasn&amp;#8217;t too close but I saw a toe-clip break free from rider and pedal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/p/Cycle/7/Look_Delta_Cleats/5300003412/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/images/look%20delta%20cleat.jpg" alt="Cleat"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire bikes have Look &amp;#8216;Delta&amp;#8217; pedals, which you can&amp;#8217;t change, though they also provide toe-clips which attach to these pedals. I&amp;#8217;m considering investing in shoes with Delta cleats.

<title>Olympic cycling squad training in Newport</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/39849000/jpg/_39849829_cycling203.jpg" alt="Velodrome"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the &lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;Newport Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; today for a second session. This time the coach let us do a little more. The best bit was cycling in group formation, taking it in turns to sprint from the head of the line until you caught up with its tail. At speed, the banked corners hurl you round like a sling-shot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding a &lt;a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/fixed-wheels-and-simple-designs"&gt;fixed wheel&lt;/a&gt; is a buzz &amp;#8212; positive and direct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Olympic cycling squad have booked the velodrome from this Thursday, 24th July, through until 5th August. They&amp;#8217;ll be using it as a training base. You&amp;#8217;d be welcome to visit and watch from the spectator area, though it&amp;#8217;s advisable to phone ahead and find out what the training schedule is for the day.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Newport Velodrome</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/images/portfolio_previews/p0000002663.jpg" alt="[Velodrome]"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt, Owen and I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;amp;amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;Newport Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; today. It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic facility. They run a drop in session for novices &amp;#8212; two of us had never ridden at a velodrome before. You just bring cycling kit and a helmet. They supply coaching, bicycles and gloves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s some thrill when you start climbing the sloping banks at the corners of the track. Keep pedalling and you&amp;#8217;ll be fine, the coach said. I kept pedalling!

<title>Cycling the Celtic Trail</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just completed the &lt;a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk"&gt;Celtic Trail&lt;/a&gt; with a couple of friends. We got off the train in Fishguard Harbour at one o&amp;#8217;clock on Friday and arrived back in Bristol late yesterday afternoon, after 240 miles of riding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id="continue-reading"/&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Prizes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;strong&gt;king of the puddings&lt;/strong&gt; prize was keenly contested, Matt led from the start and never looked like getting caught after that hors cat&amp;eacute;gorie lemon meringue pie in Carmarthen. I claim the &lt;strong&gt;pints jersey&lt;/strong&gt; by default, managing a bottle of Felinfoel double ram in Skrinkle Haven and a pint of Brains in the Bridgend Harvester; the others stuck to lucozade etc. throughout. Owen was similarly unchallenged in the &lt;strong&gt;chemical consumption competition&lt;/strong&gt; after shamelessly ingesting a cocktail of energy and recovery drinks throughout the ride &amp;#8212; though he did suggest we might like to try them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
     Chepstow is always 4 miles away.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.fontb.org.uk/index.htm"&gt;Transporter bridges&lt;/a&gt; rock.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     The righteous austerity of a youth hostel isn&amp;#8217;t what you want after a day&amp;#8217;s cycling; the anodyne comfort of a holiday inn better fits the bill.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     If you have a feeling you&amp;#8217;re going the wrong way, you&amp;#8217;ve been going the wrong way for about five miles.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     Never get separated from your friends at road junctions near Pontypridd.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     Cycle routes are great for leisure cycling but A roads are better when you want to get somewhere.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     Travel light. One bottle of sunscreen will go between three, and similarly for toothpaste.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     Hunger turns us all into children.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     Don&amp;#8217;t even think of it if you haven&amp;#8217;t done some training.
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     Visit Caerphilly.
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What&amp;#8217;s a transporter bridge?&lt;/h4&gt;
