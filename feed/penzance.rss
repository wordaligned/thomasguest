<title>Say no to noisy popcorn!</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/10/foodanddrink1"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in today&amp;#8217;s Observer says:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;The End&amp;#8217; for popcorn at the movies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of cinemas are barring the snack because it is too downmarket and messy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can cope with downmarket and I&amp;#8217;m tolerant of mess &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt; which bugs me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/10/foodanddrink1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.mcps.org/sms/popcorn.gif" alt="Bag of popcorn" style="float:right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On holiday last week, on one of those days when the rain didn&amp;#8217;t stop, we went to see what was on at the &lt;a href="http://www.merlincinemas.co.uk/"&gt;Savoy Cinema&lt;/a&gt; in Penzance. They were showing &lt;a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/wall-e/"&gt;WALL-E&lt;/a&gt;, a film I&amp;#8217;d not heard of and which, on the face of it, I would happily have avoided, but one Alex seemed to know all about. He was keen. We paid up and traipsed in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed it. For a big budget film, it was suprisingly radical. For the first hour or so there wasn&amp;#8217;t a single spoken word; the story unfolded through images and sounds (bleeps, squeaks, taps, snatches of music, the sound of a computer booting up, etc.) alone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the family behind us were scoffing popcorn served up in large and crinkly paper bags. The noise distracted me. But it&amp;#8217;s hard asking people to finish their snack before watching a film when the snack is served in the cinema foyer specifically to be taken in to accompany the show.
