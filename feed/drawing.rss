<title>Two and a bit pencils later</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/sketching-skeletons-at-bristol-museum.html" title="Sketching skeletons at Bristol Museum"&gt;Six months ago I decided&lt;/a&gt; to visit Bristol Museum on Wednesday evenings and draw interesting things until I got to the end of my sketchbook. Two and a half pencils and 51 pictures later, I&amp;#8217;m done.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/5474708308/" title="Two and a bit pencils later by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5474708308_1297ba0e07.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Two and a bit pencils later" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve made any great progress as an artist but I&amp;#8217;m happy at least to get my eye back in. Besides, in my day job, as a computer programmer, it&amp;#8217;s hard to truly finish anything, so it&amp;#8217;s good to &amp;#8212; well &amp;#8212; finish something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="400" height="300"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fthomasguest%2Fsets%2F72157624789595765%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fthomasguest%2Fsets%2F72157624789595765%2F&amp;set_id=72157624789595765&amp;jump_to="&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" allowFullScreen="true" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fthomasguest%2Fsets%2F72157624789595765%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fthomasguest%2Fsets%2F72157624789595765%2F&amp;set_id=72157624789595765&amp;jump_to=" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My appreciation of the museum has grown. I&amp;#8217;ve had time to read labels and walk through those quiet upper rooms filled with silverware and crockery. I&amp;#8217;ve noticed small details in familiar paintings. I can point out the scars in the stonework caused by war-time bomb damage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late opening on Wednesdays may be a recent idea but it&amp;#8217;s proved a rapid success. When I first started coming it seemed like I had the place to myself. Every so often a gallery attendant would drift by, but that was it. Now, though, I&amp;#8217;m not the only one who turns up to sketch, and on most Wednesdays it seems there&amp;#8217;s an event going on: &lt;a href="http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/plinth-project-by-rob.html"&gt;statues have been unveiled&lt;/a&gt;, presentations made, films shown; the year of the rabbit kicked off; exhibitions have changed; and one evening the main hall was packed with dancing brownies and balloon-filled bin-liners were emptied on them from the first floor gallery.

<title>A night at the museum, Bristol style</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/5391930761/" title="Horace Brodsky, by Gaudier-Brzeska, Bristol museum by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5137/5391930761_e413da3b83_z.jpg" width="469" height="640" alt="Horace Brodsky, by Gaudier-Brzeska, Bristol museum" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a perspex chair on the upper gallery by this sculpture. It&amp;#8217;s for the museum staff, obviously, but I didn&amp;#8217;t think they&amp;#8217;d mind me using it. I pulled it into position, sat down and began sketching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;d arrived, half-past five-ish, the museum had been quiet. Not empty, but quiet. I knew a bit about the sculptor, Gaudier-Brezska, but who was his subject, Horace Brodsky? Certainly, he looked remarkable. I could hear activity in the entrance hall below, muted voices, footsteps. I drew in the gallery&amp;#8217;s stone rail, tracing it back to the bronze musicians and the bust of Henry Irving. One day I should try and draw those wonderful chandeliers properly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;d finished I walked down the stairs towards the British wildlife gallery. The noise levels had increased. The rear hall was packed out. Positive, laidback, funky, exciting, spectacular actually.  All the chairs were occupied, people were sitting on the floor and stairs, leaning on gallery rails. On the screen was the promo video for &lt;a href="http://mshed.org"&gt;M Shed&lt;/a&gt;, which will open &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/launching-cabot-circus.html"&gt;at last&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; in 2011.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DRb2_2P_lUI" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out, the main event wasn&amp;#8217;t about M Shed, it was about the work done digitising the South West&amp;#8217;s film archive followed by a screening of some of the archive&amp;#8217;s contents. It was the first of &lt;a href="http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Leisure-Culture/Museums-Galleries/late-night-opening-at-bristol-museum---art-gallery-.en"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; to be held on the last Wednesday of the month for next few months. I watched for a while. They were showing some archive footage of trams gliding around the centre Bristol, accompanied by piano music. Next up, a street party held to celebrate the coronation.

<title>Name these puppies</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Isobel can and does lose herself in story books, devouring Jacqueline Wilson and similar. Alex is a capable reader but he prefers cartoons, comics and even catalogues. (Yes, he&amp;#8217;ll read a Nintendo DSLite games catalogue from cover to cover and memorise everything it has to say about Super Mario.) He also invents characters for use in his own cartoon strips. Last night, when we went upstairs to tuck him in, we discovered he&amp;#8217;d been drawing dogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4944113017/" title="Name the puppies by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4944113017_95965a587d.jpg" width="500" height="427" alt="Name the puppies" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t have names yet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the one with the waggly tail
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4944696724/" title="The one with the waggly tail by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4944696724_8a622e0e51_o.png" width="297" height="200" alt="The one with the waggly tail" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this one&amp;#8217;s my favourite.
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sketching skeletons at Bristol Museum</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Skeletons have interesting lines, corners and shadows, which is why I like drawing them. Here&amp;#8217;s a sketch of the Moa skeleton at Bristol museum, which you&amp;#8217;ll find just around the corner from the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7440296.stm"&gt;spiky plant-eating scelidosaurus&lt;/a&gt; and opposite the camarasaurus leg. (Courtesy of the BBC, here&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/panoramas/museum3_360.shtml"&gt;panorama&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4929241864/" title="Moa skeleton at Bristol museum by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4929241864_17164a1ce5_z.jpg" width="454" height="640" alt="Moa skeleton at Bristol museum" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id="continue-reading"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, no wings! Moas are &amp;#8212; were &amp;#8212; wingless, unlike other &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratite"&gt;ratites&lt;/a&gt;, other birds even, but what really impressed me about this specimen were its powerful legs and hips, and its chunky feet &amp;#8212; which unfortunately stretched down below the bottom of my sketch book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attendant told me I was lucky, an hour ago the gallery was full of noisy kids, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been able to sit there and draw. I nodded. Long day? I thought. Where better for kids to go on a wet day at the end of the summer holidays? A few weeks ago I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been able to sit there and draw either, not after 5pm. Late opening on Wednesdays is a &lt;a href="http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/press-releases/2010/jul/late-night-opening-at-city-museum---art-gallery.en"&gt;recent innovation&lt;/a&gt;. And a year ago I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been able to get into the museum without &lt;a href="http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/banksy-vs-bristol-museum.html"&gt;queuing for three hours first&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I intend to fill my new sketch book, get my eye back in. Wednesdays are good. I&amp;#8217;ve started now. Here&amp;#8217;s a line drawing of The Wrestler, by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, which reminds me of &lt;a href="http://www.kettlesyard.co.uk"&gt;Kettle&amp;#8217;s Yard&lt;/a&gt;. Wonderful sculpture, poor picture. I&amp;#8217;m working on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4927073230/" title="The Wrestler, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4927073230_2a071fa6f2_b.jpg" width="510" height="766" alt="The Wrestler, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<title>Weather beaten</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/2740477283/" title="Shellfish"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/2740477283_b290beb539_m.jpg" width="177" height="240" alt="shellfish" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re back from holiday a few days earlier than planned. Even if you&amp;#8217;re camping in a field surrounded by sand-dunes and just a few hundred metres from the &lt;a href="http://www.cornwallbeachguide.co.uk/penwith/gwithian/gwithian.htm"&gt;best beach in the world&lt;/a&gt;, the rain gets to you after a while.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
     body-boarding, rock-pooling, fighting the waves
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     watching Isobel and Alex ride their bicycles around the campsite
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     reading
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     a &lt;a href="http://www.thealbarestaurant.com/"&gt;memorable meal&lt;/a&gt; in St Ives
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     the &lt;a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/stives/hepworth/"&gt;Barbara Hepworth sculpture garden&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     clear roads, for once
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/stives/hepworth/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.tate.org.uk/stives/hepworth/images/garden_in_spring.jpg" alt="Sculpture garden"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so good:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
     gusting wind
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     ceaseless rain
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     damp shoes
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     pulled muscle
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;
     car trouble
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/2741314568/" title="Mousehole harbour, in the rain"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/2741314568_c62067665a.jpg" width="500" height="165" alt="mousehole" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
