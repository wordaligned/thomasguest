<title>Back to the velodrome</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Back to the velodrome today for a third session, this time with four of us. They&amp;#8217;ve extended the novice session, which now runs for a couple of hours, meaning you get a much better go. We were practising short sprints from the head of the pack when someone took a tumble. He was riding just above the blue line. Luckily I wasn&amp;#8217;t too close but I saw a toe-clip break free from rider and pedal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/p/Cycle/7/Look_Delta_Cleats/5300003412/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/images/look%20delta%20cleat.jpg" alt="Cleat"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire bikes have Look &amp;#8216;Delta&amp;#8217; pedals, which you can&amp;#8217;t change, though they also provide toe-clips which attach to these pedals. I&amp;#8217;m considering investing in shoes with Delta cleats.

<title>Olympic cycling squad training in Newport</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/39849000/jpg/_39849829_cycling203.jpg" alt="Velodrome"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the &lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;Newport Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; today for a second session. This time the coach let us do a little more. The best bit was cycling in group formation, taking it in turns to sprint from the head of the line until you caught up with its tail. At speed, the banked corners hurl you round like a sling-shot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding a &lt;a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/fixed-wheels-and-simple-designs"&gt;fixed wheel&lt;/a&gt; is a buzz &amp;#8212; positive and direct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Olympic cycling squad have booked the velodrome from this Thursday, 24th July, through until 5th August. They&amp;#8217;ll be using it as a training base. You&amp;#8217;d be welcome to visit and watch from the spectator area, though it&amp;#8217;s advisable to phone ahead and find out what the training schedule is for the day.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Newport Velodrome</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/images/portfolio_previews/p0000002663.jpg" alt="[Velodrome]"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt, Owen and I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;amp;amp;contentid=devxp001384"&gt;Newport Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; today. It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic facility. They run a drop in session for novices &amp;#8212; two of us had never ridden at a velodrome before. You just bring cycling kit and a helmet. They supply coaching, bicycles and gloves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s some thrill when you start climbing the sloping banks at the corners of the track. Keep pedalling and you&amp;#8217;ll be fine, the coach said. I kept pedalling!
