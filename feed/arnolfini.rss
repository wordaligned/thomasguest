<title>Alan Turing centenary exhibition at the Arnolfini</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chanceprojects/5489369688/&quot; title=&quot;19 timeline by neil cummings, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5215/5489369688_3784823d18.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;19 timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents are born in 1931 making them centenarians in 2031, the year in which &amp;#8212; according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/details/928&quot;&gt;Arnolfini timeline&lt;/a&gt;, a colour-coded sequence of data sprites recording the Arnolfini&amp;#8217;s presence from the Bristol riots of 1831 to the gallery&amp;#8217;s own centenary in 2061 &amp;#8212; in 2031, coincidentally, life expectancy has risen to 100. In 2031 the Arnolfini also marks Alan Turing&amp;#8217;s centenary with an exhibition, Almost Real: Composite Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/6216774835/&quot; title=&quot;Almost Real: Composite Consciousness, Alan Turing centenary exhibition by Thomas Guest, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6216774835_db9d268d22.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Almost Real: Composite Consciousness, Alan Turing centenary exhibition&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This confuses me since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turingcentenary.eu/&quot;&gt;2012 is Turing&amp;#8217;s centenary&lt;/a&gt;. He is born in 1912. In 1931 he studies mathematics at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling for more on the Almost Real exhibition, which I have yet to see, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://criticalpracticechelsea.org/wiki/index.php?title=Arnolfini_timeline#2050._Almost_Real:_Composite_Consciousness.2C_Alan_Turing_centenary_exhibition&quot;&gt;discover&lt;/a&gt; a bug in the timeline. 2031 should read &lt;strong&gt;2050&lt;/strong&gt;, 100 years after Turing publishes &lt;a href=&quot;http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/LIX/236/433.full.pdf+html&quot; title=&quot;I propose to consider the question, &#x27;Can machines think?&#x27; -- Turing&#x27;s classic paper is published in 1950&quot;&gt;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, the paper in which he considers the question &amp;#8220;Can machines think?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on &lt;a href=&quot;http://criticalpracticechelsea.org/wiki/index.php?title=Arnolfini_timeline#2050._Almost_Real:_Composite_Consciousness.2C_Alan_Turing_centenary_exhibition&quot;&gt;Almost Real&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composite Consciousness is a gift, a gift that constitutes the social identity of those that reciprocate, and in that reciprocation, the gift is the interval (the difference) between those present, and those not. The time of the disinterested gift is the time of memory &amp;#8212; it shifts the present into the future, or recollects the past into the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Launching Cabot Circus</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cabotcircus.com&quot;&gt;Cabot Circus&lt;/a&gt; is all set to open on schedule on the 25th September &amp;#8212; good going for a major building project so close to the city centre, and one which has involved the re-routing of main roads. Quite why we need a shopping centre next to an existing shopping centre defeats me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/2813567849/&quot; title=&quot;DSC00093 by Thomas Guest, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3157/2813567849_67c6ef92d6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;DSC00093&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a picture taken at the beginning of the month showing Harvey Nichols occupying the prime location previously occupied by Argos and &amp;pound;1 shops. On the same day I took a picture of work in progress on what used to be the Bristol Industrial Museum and is due to become the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Leisure-Culture/Museums-Galleries/museum-of-bristol.en&quot;&gt;Museum of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/2814431612/&quot; title=&quot;Bristol industrial museum redevelopment by Thomas Guest, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2814431612_dbd7667d83.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; alt=&quot;Bristol industrial museum redevelopment&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum sits right on the harbourside, occupying a couple of 1950s transit sheds. It has a fine collection and used to be a great place to visit. With a bit of planning I&amp;#8217;d have thought they could keep one half open while they refurbished the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so. Development runs late. Work started in 2006 and originally scheduled to complete in 2009 is now due to finish in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Leisure-Culture/Museums-Galleries/museum-of-bristol.en&quot;&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheds will be fully and sympathetically renovated.  Their historic character will be preserved and a stunning glass rooftop gallery will be added to create an additional exhibition space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s hoping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the photo from outside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Arnolfini&lt;/a&gt;, Bristol&amp;#8217;s leading centre for contemporary arts, which is housed in a &amp;#8220;sympathetically renovated&amp;#8221; tea warehouse and which, like the Industrial Museum, was closed for an extended period for refurbishment. Now reopened, it seems to have lost momentum during the redevelopment, losing gallery space and gaining a thumping great lift as its centrepiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere our priorities are wrong. Carboot Circus. Send in the clowns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
