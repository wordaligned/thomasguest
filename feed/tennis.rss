<title>Sunday Sport</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Wow! I suppose I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised that the world&amp;#8217;s third ranked tennis player can play a bit, but, much like Viktor Troicki, I was blown away by Andy Murray&amp;#8217;s performance at Wimbledon yesterday. He&amp;#8217;s got the shots and the speed and the physique and the consistency. He looks the part. On this form he&amp;#8217;ll be in the final next Sunday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Sunday is also the prologue stage of the Tour de France, a 15.5km sprint through Monaco. Bradley Wiggins should be in with a shout. But then, he fancied his chances of winning the same stage on &lt;a href="http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/transport-for-london.html"&gt;home soil in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, in the event being comfortably beaten by Fabian Cancellara. Clearly he&amp;#8217;s a better seasoned road racer this year, and he was unlucky to miss out on the final stage TT in the Giro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lance Armstrong starts the tour riding for Astana team leader and race favourite Alberto Contador. I don&amp;#8217;t suppose there&amp;#8217;ll be any team directives for the opening time-trial though, and I half expect Armstrong to attack &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/1316585412"&gt;the course&lt;/a&gt; and try and do what general-classification contenders rarely allow themselves to do: take the opening stage and wear yellow on day 2. Who&amp;#8217;ll look like leader then?
