<title>What goes around</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Well done whoever reinvented the wheel by putting spokes in it! Despite my mathematical training, it&amp;#8217;s hard to believe a such spidery arrangement of wires and air can be so strong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://tag.wordaligned.org/images/shimano-r500.jpg" alt="Shimano R500 bicycle wheel"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just such a wheel survived a high-speed run in with an &lt;a href="http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/potholes-and-ponies.html" title="Why I needed a new wheel in the first place"&gt;evil pothole&lt;/a&gt; on the north Gower road last Tuesday. Survived? Well, it remained true enough for me to complete my journey. Something was wrong though: the front brakes were juddering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wheel is the original one that came with the bike. To date, I reckon it must have gone round about 7 million times, covering a total distance in excess of 15000 km. Friction from the brakes has worn the rims away. They&amp;#8217;re concave. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id="continue-reading"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rims hadn&amp;#8217;t escaped damage. There&amp;#8217;s a bulge where they hit the pothole: hence the juddering. The next morning I ordered a Shimano R500 online from &lt;a href="http://www.merlincycles.co.uk/mountain-and-road-bike-wheels/mavic-fulcrum-and-campagnolo-wheels/shimano-r500-wheels.html" title="Merlin Cycles. Quirky website, but great deals on wheels!"&gt;Merlin Cycles&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, I ordered a pair, front and back, which worked out about the same price as a single wheel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merlin Cycles is in Preston. &lt;a href="http://www.parcelforce.com"&gt;Parcelforce&lt;/a&gt; collected my new wheels from them at 12:58 yesterday. By 22:22 in the evening they were at the National Hub. They arrived where I work before lunch today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/4407187578/" title="packing-label by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4407187578_aecf39cdb2.jpg" width="500" height="294" alt="packing-label" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wheels were made in the &lt;a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/a-look-inside-shimanos-shrouded-wheel-factory"&gt;Shimano factory&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia. According to &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=malaysia+to+preston" title="Malaysia to Preston, Wolfram Alpha"&gt;Wolfram Alpha&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; assuming (unlikely) a direct great-circle path, and assuming (correctly) that Preston is in Lancashire &amp;#8212;  they&amp;#8217;ve already covered a distance of 11404km, almost &amp;#x2153; of the earth&amp;#8217;s circumference. I wonder how many times they&amp;#8217;ve gone round?
&lt;/p&gt;
