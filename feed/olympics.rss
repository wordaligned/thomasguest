<title>Mark Cavendish regrets</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/nov/23/mark-cavendish-tour-de-france&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/11/22/cavendish460x276.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mark Cavendish&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/nov/23/mark-cavendish-tour-de-france&quot;&gt;a fine interview with sprint champion Mark Cavendish&lt;/a&gt; in today&amp;#8217;s Observer. Despite British success in the Olympics, the most exciting sporting moments for me this year were Cavendish&amp;#8217;s 4 thrilling, awesome, stage victories in the Tour de France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the TV interviews which followed these victories. After his 3rd stage win he was psyched up to make it all the way to Paris (something the sprint specialists don&amp;#8217;t always manage) and as &lt;a href=&quot;http://tag.wordaligned.org/posts/fastest-sprinter-in-the-tour-completes-a-hattrick.html&quot;&gt;I wrote at the time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to see him storming round the Champs-&amp;Eacute;lys&amp;eacute;es &amp;#8212; if he gets there, he&amp;#8217;ll win the final stage too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after his 4th stage win, he became subdued and tetchy, and all of a sudden he&amp;#8217;d quit the race to stay fresh for the Olympics. Ironically his Olympic partner in the Madison, Bradley Wiggins, was the one lacking freshness &amp;#8212; hardly surprising since he&amp;#8217;d already won two gold medals in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/lsv/index.shtml&quot;&gt;Laoshan Velodrome&lt;/a&gt;, setting a world record in the process &amp;#8212; and Cavendish now regrets his decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;The biggest regret of my career is quitting the Tour de France,&amp;#8217; Cavendish continues, looking back on his decision to leave this year&amp;#8217;s race after stage 14 so that he would be fresh for the Olympics. &amp;#8216;I feel massively let down, I&amp;#8217;m still bitter now. To leave the Tour de France to do that. You sit there, sit there, you&amp;#8217;re the last event on, every single member of the team has got a medal, the pressure&amp;#8217;s on you and, boom, it goes. You don&amp;#8217;t get it, even though I still think I was the best rider on the track. It&amp;#8217;s quite hard to accept really.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Those medalling athletes</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7563581.stm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.geekologie.com/2007/05/23/beinjing-olympic-medals-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Medals&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7563581.stm&quot;&gt;weekend&lt;/a&gt;, I hadn&amp;#8217;t realised the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/medal&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;medal&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; could be used as verb. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rebeccaromero.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Rebecca Romero&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few athletes to medal in two different sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context makes the meaning obvious &amp;#8212; I didn&amp;#8217;t think she&amp;#8217;d been &lt;em&gt;meddling&lt;/em&gt; in two sports. I guess this use of the word is new to me because team GB haven&amp;#8217;t medalled this well in my lifetime. Let&amp;#8217;s hope they medal in some track and field events too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
