<title>Headwinds</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The wind has been picking up over the last few weeks. Last Thursday it was gusty and fresh &amp;#8212; riding my bike felt like wading through waves. Tonight the wind was more forceful. Out of Swansea city suburbs and on the exposed Gower Road, I dropped into a low gear and dug in, tunneling for home. In places I had to stand on the pedals and wrench the handlbars just to stay in control. Debris flew past in the darkness. It took me well over an hour to get from Swansea station to Reynoldston, a personal worst by some margin. On Saturday I&amp;#8217;m running the &lt;a href="http://www.endurancelife.com/event.asp?series=36&amp;amp;location=98"&gt;Gower coastal half marathon&lt;/a&gt;. If the weather&amp;#8217;s like this Rhossili Down will be brutal.
