<h3>The Gadget Show reviews folding bikes</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rebeccaromero.co.uk/"><img src="http://www.rebeccaromero.co.uk/images/morph3.gif" style="float:left;" alt="Rebecca Romero medalled in rowing and cycling"/></a>
</p>
<p>I watched the <a href="http://fwd.five.tv/gadget-show">Gadget Show</a> on 5 last night because I was interested in hearing what cycling gold <a href="http://www.rebeccaromero.co.uk/">Rebecca Romero</a> would have to say about folding bikes. What interested me most, in fact, was that she said she hadn&#8217;t ridden a bike since winning the 3km individual pursuit in Beijing. I guess that&#8217;s the difference between using a bike to get around on and doing what it takes to win a gold medal.
</p>
<p>I do cycle for leisure and fitness; but for me cycling is primarily a means of transport and I ride a bicycle on most days. I&#8217;ve always hankered after a folding bicycle but never could quite justify the purchase: after all, I already had a touring bike and a &#8220;mountain bike&#8221; (in quotes since it never went near any mountains; rather I used it as a sturdy bike to which a child seat could be fitted).
</p>
<p>My children have their own bikes now and the mountain bike has long gone. A couple of years ago I decided to finally buy a foldie. I regularly visit my employer&#8217;s London office, and a folding bike gets me to either of the Bristol mainline stations (Temple Meads and Parkway), and between Paddington and Farringdon at the other end of the journey. Also, I can fold up the bike and sling it in the back of the car &#8212; very handy when driving somewhere to cycle with the family.
</p>

<h3>Rebecca Romero hates Stridas</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.strida.co.uk"><img style="float:right;" src="http://www.strida.nl/en/images/strida5/strida5-bike.jpg" alt="Strida 5"/></a>
</p>
<p>I decided on a <a href="http://www.strida.co.uk">Strida</a>. A Strida 3, in fact. I&#8217;ve been generally happy with it. I used it this morning when I dropped the car off at the garage for its MOT.
</p>
<p>Rebecca Romero reviewed the latest Strida, a Strida 5, last night. It&#8217;s half as expensive again as the model I bought, and looks to be the same distinctive design but with several components tuned and improved. She found it an uncomfortable ride and couldn&#8217;t wait to get off, resulting in a final verdict of just one out of five stars.
</p>

<h3>I give mine three out of five</h3>
<p><a href="http://ottawafilmreview.blogspot.com/2008/07/nostalgia-of-france-in-1947.html"><img src="http://img5.allocine.fr/acmedia/medias/nmedia/18/36/02/36/18445934.jpg" alt="Jacques Tati on his bike"/></a>
</p>
<p>My experience with the Strida has been very different. I enjoy riding mine. I wouldn&#8217;t want to go a long way on it. It has just one gear, and while the upright riding position makes for fun &#8212; you feel a bit like cycling postman Jacques Tati in the picture above &#8212; it certainly isn&#8217;t the most efficient. Who cares? I&#8217;ve got a road bike for long distances. The Strida is for nipping to and from stations, or across town. For such use it&#8217;s great.
</p>
<p><a href="/posts/google-maps-for-the-humanpowered.html"><img src="/images/walking-directions.png" alt="Muddled map"/></a>
</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I managed to cycle mine up Bristol&#8217;s notorious <a href="/posts/google-maps-for-the-humanpowered.html">Mont D&#8217;Arbres Neuf</a>, a hors cat&eacute;gorie climb so savage Google maps refuse to offer directions up it, though I did have to tack from side to side of the road.
</p>
<p>The Strida is light. It&#8217;s a doddle to assemble. The brakes are positive. Just getting on it makes me smile. I get smiles when I ride it too. It&#8217;s pretty much zero maintenance. The chain is kevlar and nothing needs oiling &#8212; very nice for a bike you might want to park indoors.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m marking it down because:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     it doesn&#8217;t fold as small as some other bikes
 </li>

 <li>
     it&#8217;s not the most robust. You wouldn&#8217;t want to hop on and off pavements on it, and I&#8217;m careful to avoid pot-holes
 </li>

 <li>
     the kevlar chain can slip if you apply too much force on a wet day.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, I think I made a good choice. Nowadays I wouldn&#8217;t want to be without a foldie.
