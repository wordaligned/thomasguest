</p>
<p>Newbridge fields is closest to home of the Gwent League events and, since changing jobs at the end of August, it&#8217;s even closer to where I work. During the weeks before the event I&#8217;d reconoitred the course in my lunch break. It&#8217;s a straightforward route, three flat laps around the boundary of the playing fields and back alongside the Ogmore, each finishing with a bridge crossing and a short switchback through a wooded meadow.
</p>
<p>Late summer and early autumn have been dry, and even the meadow section wasn&#8217;t bad underfoot as I warmed up. Yet again, no need for my spikes: I wore my light but grip-less racing flats.
</p>
<p>Alex&#8217;s school friend, Nathan Jones, was in the Swansea Harriers tent near the race HQ. I&#8217;ve been training with him on Tuesday evenings and it was no surprise to see the Welsh gold medal hanging round his neck. Unfortuntely I arrived too late to see his race. Apparently he&#8217;d been disappointed to finish a close second, losing out to an English runner &#8212; at least he has someone to aim for in the next fixture.
</p>
<p>Well over 400 runners lined up at the start of the men&#8217;s event. I positioned myself as close to the front as I dared, not wanting to get stuck in a queue around the first corner. We were off, surging forwards at speed. I held my position, using elbows and hands to make space for myself.
</p>

</p>
<p>Coming into the technical meadow section at the end of the first lap, I was running well. My shoes had barely any grip in the mud, and I would have to rely on momentum and foot placement to carry me up the two short climbs. A Bristol University runner fell, got up, slipped over again; somehow I kept going and passed him. Spike- and stud-less I took no chances on the soft downhill.
</p>
<p>I tried to hold my pace in the second lap. My starting speed had put me ahead of several runners who would normally be in front of me. I wanted to stay clear of them. Coming into the race, the first of this season&#8217;s league, I knew my form was good. It was the West Wales championships. I had also been told that the selectors would have their eye on the results; a strong performance here would put me in contention for a place on the Welsh team at the masters international in Glasgow. So, some motivation.
</p>
<p>Into the third lap now and I picked up my pace again. I recognised the runner ahead, Alex Hamblin, Westbury Harriers. <a href="/posts/blaise-blazer-2016">Last time I saw him</a> he had finished maybe 10m ahead of me in torrid conditions at the Blaise Blazer. Today, on a longer and flatter course, I was catching him. I passed him before the bridge. I passed two or three others too.
</p>
<p>I dropped a couple of places in the final meadow section &#8212; others were attacking the finish of the race, and I was unwilling to take risks in my slippery shoes. I sprinted with what little I had left for the line. I collected my position token and, as ever, a letter from Hedydd Davies iniviting me to represent West Wales in the inter-regional championships. The next two Swansea Harriers to finish were Eamonn and Ifan, two strong veteran runners who
   normally leave me trailing by some distance: confirmation I&#8217;d run well.

<p><a href="http://www.gwent-league.org.uk/2016/sm161i.htm">The results</a> were published later that week confirming I&#8217;d finished 74th out of 468 with a time of 38.27. Even better, I got a message from Bernie Jones, the Welsh Masters team manager. I&#8217;d been selected to run for Wales at the home cross country international in Glasgow.
