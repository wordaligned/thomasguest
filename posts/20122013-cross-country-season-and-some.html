<p>About time I recorded some of my race results since the <a href="/posts/welsh-castles-relay-2012.html">WCR, 2012</a>.
</p>
<p>My next race was the <a href="http://www.gwent-league.org.uk">Gwent League</a> opener at Newbridge Fields, Bridgend. I ran this same course the year before on a cold, blustery day, sheets of rain swirling. This time, the weather turned out unseasonably warm. I came <a href="http://www.gwent-league.org.uk/2012/sm121i.htm">78th with a time of 38:22</a>, an improvement of 26 places and 3 minutes over my previous outing.
</p>

</p>
<p>Soon after I ran closer to home in the <a href="http://westglamleague.co.uk/3.html">West Glamorgan League at Llanmadoc</a>. Although the rain held off on the day, it hadn&#8217;t over the past weeks and the track out to the lighthouse comprised a series of ponds linked by mud. I made a mistake lining up for the start some way from the front of the field and ended up jostled and sodden by the time the race stretched out and settled in. After, I hooked up with Ifan for a warm down; we ran the full route a second time.

</p>
<p>Blaise Castle, Bristol, for the 3rd fixture in the Gwent League. Isobel and Alex ran too. I tried to keep up with Eamon but he pulled away on the second lap. In the closing stages I looked over my shoulder to see Raul storming towards me. I had enough left, or he timed his surge for the line too late; either way I <a href="http://www.gwent-league.org.uk/2012/sm123i.htm">finished ahead of him</a>, but I can&#8217;t see that happening next time we race together.
</p>
<p>And that was it, my cross country season over. I was supposed to run the Welsh regional cross country championships but didn&#8217;t make it.
</p>
<p>Towards the end of January this year I ran the <a href="http://www.bristolandwestac.org/bridge-inn-5k">Bridge Inn 5K</a> on a very windy night and did well to finish <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzIFRjtRS2vBVkE3b1dWV0RrUUU/edit">a few seconds</a> before Matt Burns.
</p>
<p>Last night I ran the first of four alliterative <a href="http://www.tach.org.uk/races.php">TACH races</a>, the Wrington Woodland run, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/v2/181608257/218757">course</a> started in Cleeve with a long but gradual climb up a woodland track. After a few dry weeks the surface was rocky and rutted. Matt (who I beat in the 5K, remember?) strode ahead a few minutes in, clocking a pace I couldn&#8217;t follow; and, as it turned out, noone else could either. As we crested the top of the climb Andy overtook me. On the descent to Wrington another runner bounded past. I wasn&#8217;t feeling too fresh by Bullnose Lane, the second uphill section, and settled on trying to hold my place rather than catch anyone. Even that proved optimistic and a couple of runners pegged me back before the final descent back to Cleeve.
</p>
<p>I was pleased with <a href="http://www.tach.org.uk/result.php?race=wrington_result13.inc">9th place</a>. Congratulations to Matt on his well deserved win! A diet of interval training and competitive racing have honed his form and after a series of top ten placings in recent events it came down to when not if.
