<p>The half marathon I enjoyed most was the first one I ran, the Bath half, back in &#8230; I&#8217;m not even sure, 12 years ago? I didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d be able to finish because I hadn&#8217;t run the distance in training, so I started slowly.
</p>
<p>As the race progressed I realised I <strong>would</strong> finish, no problem, and I remember overtaking people in the second loop and sprinting the last stretch along Great Pulteney Street, crossing the line with a time of 1:42:15. Oh, I felt just great!
</p>
<p>Since then I&#8217;ve run a few more half marathons and at each one I&#8217;ve gone faster. At first I hacked chunks from my personal best but as time went on I was reduced to chipping away smaller gains. In 2003 I went below an hour and a half at Bristol, beating Steve Cram. In 2006 I returned to Bath and clocked <a href="bath_half_2006.pdf">1:23:14</a>. Wow! I didn&#8217;t think I could better that but running the same event in 2007 I got down to 1:21:58 &#8212; which meant running the first 9 miles at a speed of 6 minutes and 15 seconds per mile and then running the final 4 miles at the same speed, even though at every step every bit of me wanted it to end.
</p>
<p>On that day I retired from half marathons. I couldn&#8217;t go any faster and I couldn&#8217;t face up to going any slower and I hurt and I had had enough.
</p>
<p>I kept running though. Cross country is my favourite, all weather, all terrain. I started going out with a group close to where I live, on Gower. Sand dunes, wooded tracks, marshland. Cefn Bryn from all faces. I joined a club in Bristol, where I work, threading through the alleyways and parkland of North Bristol. Then I hooked up with some friends for training runs on Wednesday lunchtimes.

</p>
<p>Earlier this year, 6 March 2011, and friends from all of these groups were running the Bath half marathon. The weather was good. I was in fine form. As I said in an email to Andy:
</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m thinking my build-up for the Bath half has been pretty much perfect, except for my failure to enter, that is.
</p>
</blockquote><p>Andy went on to finish the race in a time of 1:21:51 &#8212; fully half a second a mile faster than I&#8217;d ever run. That did it! Later that week I signed up for the Bristol half marathon, to be run on September 11th 2011.
</p>
<p>Today.
</p>
<p>In the years since I&#8217;ve been away, the Bristol half has become a huge event. I&#8217;d been assigned a white number which meant I&#8217;d be starting in the first section of the first wave. It still took me over 30 seconds to pass beneath the start line and I spent the first couple of miles dodging joggers with ipods and sharp elbowed veterans. Beneath the suspension bridge the race stretched out. I galloped along the portway. Soon after doubling back at Shirehampton I pulled alongside someone I knew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that Neil?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, How&#8217;s it going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too damn fast. I&#8217;m going too fast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah, you&#8217;re fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I shook my head. I <strong>was</strong> going too fast but I couldn&#8217;t slow down. Even though I was hurting and hadn&#8217;t even gone halfway I let momentum take me past Neil and on to Spike Island. Already I wanted it over.
</p>
<p>The route came back to the centre of town then cruelly swerved out again on an unwelcome tour of the sights. Great for spectators. Cobbles. Ramps. <a href="http://www.seenoevilbristol.co.uk/">Grafitti</a>. I was being overtaken. Falling away. Neil came smoothly past.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done mate,&#8221; I muttered.
</p>
<p>400m to go. At least I had space around me. Noone passed me in the final straight.
</p>
<p>I pressed the button on my stop watch and collapsed, wiped out. I hurt and I knew I was going to hurt more tomorrow and the day after. There was Neil. I eased up on to my feet, started moving, slowly.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/6137800028/" title="1:22:14.94 by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6137800028_a469bae0a1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="1:22:14.94"></a>
</p>
<p>1:22:14 my watch said.
</p>
<p>As the event has grown bigger they&#8217;ve figured out how to organise it. You aren&#8217;t allowed to pile-up round the finish line snatching goodie bags and hugging loved ones. They keep the exhausted, elated runners moving past a succession of hand-outs: space blanket, water, medal, banana, T-shirt, energy drink, leaflet, bag &#8230; and after this personal awards ceremony you emerge light-headed into the sunshine in millenium square.
</p>
<p>Neil ran 1:22:06, comfortably. For him, this was a training run: he&#8217;s looking for a fast time in Stroud. My official time, <a href="http://www.runbristol.com/SearchResults.aspx">online now</a>, is 1:22:15. That&#8217;s over a second a mile slower than I&#8217;ve run before. I give in.
