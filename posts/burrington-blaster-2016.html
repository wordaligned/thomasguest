<p>It helps to have run the <a href="http://www.tach.org.uk/tach-races/">TACH races</a> before, so you can gauge your effort for what&#8217;s coming. I <a href="/posts/the-tach-ticks-talk">have run the Burrington Blaster previously</a>, but just the once, three years ago. From memory, we were facing a never-ending uphill followed by a treacherous downhill.</p>
<p>Either my recollections were faulty or we&#8217;d gone the wrong way, because, after an initial climb the route levelled then dipped. We were running full tilt downhill when, in my head, we should have been grinding uphill.</p>
<p>I was relieved when the course did turn upwards. My legs were ready. We shook off a few runners who&#8217;d been seduced by the fast start. Now I ran with three training partners: Andy, Neil, Paul. How many times have we climbed Nightingale Valley together, only to find ourselves shoulder to shoulder in a race? Paul set the pace. I expected Andy to pull away &#8212; he&#8217;s been flying recently &#8212; but eventually it was me who picked up the pace, passing Paul as the climb opened out from the woods and on to the top of the beacon.</p>
<p>Last time out this exposed section had been windy, wet and boggy. Today found the going still and dry. My chance was now! Convinced longer legs would catch me I hurled myself at the first open downhill, launching off ridges, sliding on bare earth, using the grassy verge to decelerate as needed. I knew my pursuers had me in view and didn&#8217;t want them to think they were closing in. Now the patch narrowed and swerved though bracken, gorse, brambles, still downhill. Room for one only: noone could pass.</p>
<p>I was on my own anyway. No sight of anyone ahead. No sound of anyone behind &#8212; even if you cannot hear a chaser directly, you can hear the spectators cheering them, or marshals guiding them. Of course you would never look back!</p>
<p>The final woodland descent, I took carefully. <a href="/posts/the-tach-ticks-talk">Three years ago</a> I&#8217;d lost fourth place slipping and falling, and had considered myself lucky not to get hurt.</p>
<p>Today, I finished unscathed, 4th overall and 1st veteran, with a time of 35:36.</p>

<p>The winner, Chris McMillan, completed the course in a blistering time of 32:33, nearly two minutes clear of the next runner.</p>
