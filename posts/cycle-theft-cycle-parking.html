<p>He won&#8217;t get my vote just for riding a bicycle, but I sympathise with David Cameron whose bike was stolen two days ago:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was cycling home and stopped to pick up some things for supper. I chained the bike through the wheel then put it around one of those bollard things. I have reported it using the police&#8217;s new online facility but I&#8217;m not expecting to get it back any time soon.&#8221; James Theophile, 60, spoke to Mr Cameron moments after he emerged from the Tesco store: &#8220;It was quite ridiculous of him to lock his bike against such a short post.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/jul/25/davidcameron.ukcrime">guardian.co.uk</a>
</p>
</blockquote><p>The car park outside my local Tesco store was redesigned recently and guess how many dedicated cycle parking racks they installed? None. I had to find a way to somehow secure my bike to the edge of the trolley store where it was in the way and at risk of getting damaged. Now they&#8217;ve put in a tiny cycle parking area but it&#8217;s always full. Quite ridiculous.
</p>
<blockquote><p>A spokesman for Tesco said: &#8220;We are very sorry that David&#8217;s bike was stolen from outside our store. David&#8217;s setting a great example to everyone by using his bike to get around so we&#8217;ll make a donation to bicycling charity Sustrans that might help ease his loss.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7523144.stm">news.bbc.co.uk</a>
</p>
</blockquote><p>Forget the donation. Set an example and fix your cycle parking facilities!
</p>
<p>High profile bike theft makes the news but in my experience Cameron is right to claim it won&#8217;t excite the police. Even where I know there&#8217;s proper cycle parking I won&#8217;t leave my bicycle outside in the evening, let alone overnight. If thieves can&#8217;t take the bike they&#8217;ll strip what they can from the frame. Have you ever tried wheeling a bike home which has no handlebars and no front wheel?
