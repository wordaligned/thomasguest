<p>At the start of the month I attempted the <a href="http://www.tach.org.uk/races.php">Wrington Woodland</a> run. Conditions were warm and damp. The race starts with a gradual climb from Goblin Coombe. I was tracking the leaders at this stage. The rocky track became a river of viscous clay. A Frome runner slipped and slithered, his <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/running_mens.htm">five fingers</a> affording little traction. I moved past into second place.</p>

<p>My own shoes &#8212; my normally trusty Adidas swoop trail shoes &#8212; skidded on the fast tarmac descent to Wrington. I slowed down then pushed on, determined to hold my position. On the second climb, the steep one up Bullhouse Lane, my right calf went. I limped, then walked, then tried to run through the injury, then walked again. I was in some pain. Runners passed me. I&#8217;m fine, I said, it&#8217;s cramp. The woods on top of Wrington Hill were packed with bluebells. A kindly marshal gave me a lift back to the HQ once the race had passed. My first ever DNF. I felt lousy.</p>

<p>Yesterday, three weeks later, I showed up for the <a href="http://nailsearunningclub.org.uk/club-races/">Tyntesfield 10</a> &#8212; a favourite event from last year. My calf still isn&#8217;t 100% but I needed to get round the course to put Wrington behind me. I could surely do that.</p>
<p>I started easily on the first meadow circuit. We looped back to the house, swerving round the croquet lawn and flowerbeds, then back to the meadow again. My legs felt good. I pushed on towards the woods, passing runners as the track rose. Watch out for tree roots! Go on Southville! The track twists and swerves, hurdling fallen trees, ducking under branches. I was glad to be clear and able to pick my own route. Andy Malloy cruised past. I drafted him, pulling me into contention with a couple of other runners.</p>
<p>Out of the woods and into long grass, nettles, thistles, rape. At this stage last year I&#8217;d been wiped out. Today, a more cautious start had earned me something in reserve. To my surprise, Annabel Granger was in range, plus another couple of runners I didn&#8217;t know. At last we reached the long descent bringing the route back home. I passed one runner. I passed two more, only for them to nip ahead when I misinterpreted a marshal&#8217;s signal and turned the wrong way. Down the steps and on to the tarmac. I dug in on the final short climb, regaining my earlier position. On the finishing straight, for the first time in the race, I looked behind me. My position was safe. I crossed the line.</p>
<p>Training mate Neil Williams was so close behind I didn&#8217;t see him finish. I cheered in another friend, Steve Swan, drank the water and ate the minuscule cereal bar in the goodie bag.</p>

<p>I was 7th to finish and 1st in my category. My time, <a href="https://www.fullonsport.co.uk/fos/index.php?module=results&amp;eventId=4350&amp;action=results" title="Race results">40:39</a>, was 22 seconds faster than at the same event last year. Next up: the Welsh Castles Relay.</p>
