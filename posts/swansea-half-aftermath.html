<p><a href="/posts/swansea-half-2014">Clocking a sub-80 half marathon at Swansea</a> was my finest running performance in 2014. Things were bound to cool off after that.  Just four days later I showed up for the Purdown Pursuit, the final event of the <a href="http://www.tach.org.uk/races.php">Tach summer series</a>. The race started late and required re-routing; it was a sweltering evening and there&#8217;d been a fire on the course. I took the downhill sections cautiously on sore legs but still managed <a href="http://www.tach.org.uk/result.php?race=PP_result14.inc">4th place with a time of 42.39</a>. 
</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later I finished 5th at the Blaise Blazer mob match. It&#8217;s one of my favourite races and I set a personal best for the course of <a href="http://www.runbritainrankings.com/results/results.aspx?meetingid=106696&amp;event=4MMT&amp;venue=Bristol&amp;date=4-Aug-14">23.51</a>, picking runners off steadily in the final stages then holding on in the final sprint from the top of the steps to the folly. Southville RC put on a spirited defence of the team prize we&#8217;d won the year before and, once the results had been counted and checked, to our surprise, it was announced we&#8217;d retained the trophy. Later that evening after a recount the results were corrected; Westbury Harriers had, in fact, wrested the coveted Blazer Cup from our grasp.
</p>
<p>My mistake was not resting up over the summer. I wanted to go under 80 minutes for a second time at the Cardiff half marathon, a far more established and prestigious event than the one I&#8217;d run in Swansea, and one at which friends from both Bristol and South Wales would compete. On the Monday before the race I tweaked my hamstring towards the end of a track session with Bristol &amp; West at Whitehall. Not good. During the remainder of the week I rested before lining up on Sunday in Cardiff ready to race. I stormed the first mile in 5:40, hit a similar pace for the second, and then felt the injury ping. I pulled up and walked along the pavement, assessing the damage. I figured I could at least jog around the barrage to the Senedd but I couldn&#8217;t. Instead I ended up limping from Pennarth to the centre, reaching the baggage collection around the time I should have been finishing.

<p>I didn&#8217;t race again until the combined Welsh Inter-regional and Welsh Masters cross country championships. This is a proper cross-country course featuring mud, meadows, woodland tracks, slopes. The weather played its part: rain during the week and freezing temperatures on the day filled the puddles with ice; grass sparkled with frost as the sun broke through. I ran a measured race ending up with an individual <a href="http://www.thepowerof10.info/results/results.aspx?meetingid=118689&amp;event=ZXC&amp;venue=Builth+Wells&amp;date=13-Dec-14">silver in the MV50</a> category just two seconds behind Peter Coles, the category winner. I <strong>did</strong> get a gold medal as one of Swansea Harriers&#8217; winning MV50 team. In the inter-regional competition, we came second, I think. There are so many competitions being run in the same race it&#8217;s hard to remember. What I do remember thinking is, what a shame such a great event gets such a low turnout. In an age where people part with serious money to tackle military-themed tough guy obstacle courses, for just a couple of quid you get to represent club and region on a challenging course in a fabulous setting.
