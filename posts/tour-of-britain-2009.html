<p>I took my bike to <a href="http://www.fredbakercycles.co.uk/">Fred Baker cycles</a> to investigate a transmission problem &#8212; the freehub sometimes failed to latch, especially after freewheeling. It turned out the whole wheel needed changing. They had some basic quality spares in the shop but I decided to order a decent replacement. The bike was still usable.
</p>
<p>That evening I watched the Tour of Britain highlights <a href="http://www.itv.com/cycling">programme on ITV4</a>. The <a href="http://www.tourofbritain.co.uk/_ns_race/stage5_route.asp">Stage 5</a> route was a slog through the potteries. I can&#8217;t put my finger on why exactly, but the event seemed low-key: minor roads, poor surfaces, huddles of school kids clutching flimsy flags. Maybe the over-enthusiastic commentary put me off: those slopes weren&#8217;t mountains, hardly hills even, and three spectators doesn&#8217;t make a crowd. I missed the slick pazazz of the well rehearsed Tour de France coverage.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I decided to check out the event for real. After all, the statistics showed the riders were going every bit as fast as any stage in a proper tour, and <a href="http://www.southwesttourofbritain.co.uk/">Stage 6 would be starting in Frome</a>, not 30 miles away.
</p>

</p>
<p>The next morning was a glorious one for cycling. The bike seemed fine. I avoided freewheeling and got to Frome before 9. The race was to start from Market Yard Car Park. I bought a bacon roll and a coffee, snaffled some energy bar samples, listened to the live event radio, wandered around the town centre. They&#8217;d held a <a href="http://www.southwesttourofbritain.co.uk/info-for-residents-businesses/road-closures/">Cobble Wobble</a> race up Catherine Hill the evening before, and the shop windows along the street had cycle-themed displays. At about 9:30 a posse of police motorbike riders rolled up. A good day to commit a crime, someone said. Soon after came the team cars, glossy road bikes strapped to their roofs.
</p>

</p>
<p>Having watched a few riders sign in I decided to head out of town. I wanted to see the peleton at full speed, not rolling out of a car park. I was surprised to be allowed to use the actual stage route less than half an hour before the race was due to start. As I climbed the hill out of town I noticed a crowd of pupils standing in front of their school at the side of the road. They wore bright yellow reflective vests. As I passed, out of the saddle and stamping hard on the pedals, they cheered and waved their flags.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/3931302098/" title="Here they come! by Thomas Guest, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2673/3931302098_809d25d166.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Here they come!" /></a>
</p>
<p>A few miles down the road I found a good place to stop. For the next 20 minutes police riders flashed by. It seemed more like a motorbike race than a bicycle race. All of a sudden the peleton arrived, at speed. Seconds later, they were gone.
</p>
<p>On my way back, just before Pensford, my freehub abruptly and finally stopped working. I now had a bike suitable for downhill only. I got a taxi back into Bristol. Later that evening I watched the TV coverage. I saw Somerset and Devon bathed in sunshine, a high-speed breakaway topping Exmoor, pegged back by a ruthless peleton alongside the Torridge estuary, a last gasp sprint. Colour me convinced.
